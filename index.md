## Larry Han

I am a 2nd year PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I am advised by Professor Tianxi Cai and Professor Lorenzo Trippa. Previously, I obtained my MPhil in Management Operations from the University of Cambridge under the guidance of Professor Stefan Scholtes and my MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University as part of the inaugural class of Schwarzman Scholars. I completed my bachelors in biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I am interested in developing statistical methods and applications for clinical medicine and pubilc health problems, especially in the analysis of clinical trials, electronic health records and real-world data.  

If you can't reach me, it's likely that I'm on the **golf** course, catching up on the latest in _US-China relations_, or `cheering` on the Tar Heels basketball team!
