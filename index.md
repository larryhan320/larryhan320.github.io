I'm a 3rd-year PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University. My research focuses on developing statistical methods to leverage the sub-optimality of real world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. I'm lucky to be advised by Professor Tianxi Cai and Professor Lorenzo Trippa.

Previously, I obtained my MPhil in Management Operations from the University of Cambridge under the guidance of Professor Stefan Scholtes and my MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University as an inaugural [Schwarzman Scholar](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/). I completed my bachelors in biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

If you can't reach me, it's likely that I'm on the golf course, catching up on the latest in US-China relations, or cheering on the Tar Heels!
